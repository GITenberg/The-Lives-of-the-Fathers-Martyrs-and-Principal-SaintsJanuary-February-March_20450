description: Butler's great work, The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal
  Saints ("Butler's Lives"), the result of thirty years study (first published in
  four volumes, London, 1756-1759), has passed through many editions and translations
  (best edition, including valuable notes, Dublin, 12 vols. 1779-1780). It is a popular
  and compendious reproduction of the Acta Sanctorum, exhibiting great industry and
  research, and is in all respects the best compendium of Acta in English.- Excerpted
